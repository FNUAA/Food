Instructions: Let the Spaghetti sit in boiling water for 8-10 minutes. While the the Spaghetti is boiling, sprinkle the salt into the water and let it mix in.
- Then put spill the Spaghetti and boiling water into a filtering pan over a sink. Let the water fall through until it completely fall down the drainage hole.
- After finishing those two seperate steps, dump the remaining Spaghetti onto a plate, or into a bowl.
- Now, take your Olive Oil, and squeze the oil into a different pan seperate from the Spaghetti pan.
- Next, take your Garlic and dump it into the pan with the Olive Oil.
- Stir the pan, until you are satisfyied with the Garlic aroma.
- Take your Meatballs and let them fall into the Garlic pan.
- A step later, and you spill the Marina Sauce into the pan, and wait untill the Meatballs turn brown.
- You can now take the Oregano, and the Black Pepper and pour/ sprinkle them into the pan.
- Finally, dump the Spaghetti and Parmesan Cheese into the pan, and mix it. You can then pour out the contents of the pan into a plate, ready to eat! However, before you digest     your now fully completed Spaghetti and Meatballs, please take one small bite out of your Spaghetti, and one small bite of one of your Meatballs. If you feel that your food is     cold, make sure to put the plate in a microwave,(with no settings(such as pizza mode, or de-frost), other than default), and warm it up for 15 seconds.
